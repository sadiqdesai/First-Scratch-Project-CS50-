This is my first project of Harvard CS50 cource in this project i made a game in which we will be able to shoot bullets from a rocket by pressing space button and we will be able to move the rocket left and right from left and right keys the game will ends once rocket gets hit by a rock and you will get 2 points for every rock you hit
PROBLEM I AM FACING:once we shoot a rock all the other rocks respawn and they will keep respawning so they never falls i cant figure out how to solve this problem and also make it more efficient
FAVOUR:it will be a fovour to let me know how can i solve this problem

THANK YOU
